# One million Lyft rides


This question was asked by: Lyft <br/>
Let's say we have 1 million Lyft rider journey trips in the city of Seattle. We want to build a model to predict ETA after a rider makes a Lyft request.
<br/><br/>
How would we know if we have enough data to create an accurate enough model?
