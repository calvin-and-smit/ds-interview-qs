# Interview Query Question #4 | Rejection Reason


Good morning. Here's your modeling question for today.

This question was asked by: Affirm
Suppose we have a binary classification model that classifies whether or not an applicant should be qualified to get a loan. Because we are a financial company we have to provide each rejected applicant with a reason why.

Given we don't have access to the feature weights, how would we give each rejected applicant a reason why they got rejected?
