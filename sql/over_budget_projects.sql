Over budget on a project is defined when the salaries, prorated to the day, exceed the budget of the project.

For example, if Alice and Bob both combined income make 200K and work on a project of a budget of 50K that takes half a year, then the project is over budget given 0.5 * 200K = 100K > 50K.

Write a query to select all projects that are over budget. Assume that employees only work on one project at a time.
