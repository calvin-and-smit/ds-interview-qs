First Touch Attribution
Good morning. Here's your sql question for today.

This question was asked by: Google
`attribution` table

column	type
id	int
created_at	datetime
session_id	int
channel	varchar
conversion	boolean
`user_sessions` table

column	user_id
session_id	int
user_id	int
The schema above is for a retail online shopping company.

The attribution table logs each user visit where a user comes onto their site to go shopping. If conversion = 1, then on that session visit the user converted and bought an item. The channel column represents which advertising platform the user got to the shopping site on that session. The `user_sessions` table maps each session visit back to the user.

First touch attribution is defined as the channel to which the converted user was associated with when they first discovered the website. Calculate the first touch attribution for each user_id that converted.

Example output:

user_id	channel
123	facebook
145	google
153	facebook
172	organic
173	email
