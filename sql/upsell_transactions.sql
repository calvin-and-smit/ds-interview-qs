Upsell Transactions
Good morning. Here's your sql question for today.

This question was asked by: Coinbase
Given a transaction table of product purchases, write a query to get the number of customers 
that were upsold by purchasing additional products.

Note that if the customer purchased two things on the same day that does not count as an upsell 
as they were purchased within a similar timeframe. Each row in the transactions table also 
represents an individual user product purchase.


transactions table

column	        type
user_id	        int
created_at	datetime
product_id	int
quantity	int
price	        float
