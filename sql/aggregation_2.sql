Question 44 - Joining to get total sales, a SQL problem
________________________________________
Suppose you work for a retail company that has a database containing two tables, one called 'orders', and one called 'revenue', 
as shown below: 

Orders: 
	order_id	channel		date		month
0	1		Online		2018-09-01	September
1	2		Online		2018-09-03	September
2	3		In_store	2018-10-11	October
3	4		In_store	2018-08-21	August
4	5		Online		2018-08-13	August
5	6		Online		2018-10-29	October


Revenue: 
	order_id	revenue
0	1		100
1	2		125
2	3		200
3	4		80
4	5		200
5	6		100

Using SQL, write a query to show the total revenue by channel for the months of September and October. 
Additionally, try to think of the most efficient way to run this query.

*******************************************************************************************************************/

select channel. month, sum(revenue) as total_revenue
from
(
select a.*, b.revenue
from Orders as a
left join Revenue as b
on a.order_id = b.order_id
where month = "September" or month = "October"
)
group by channel, month
