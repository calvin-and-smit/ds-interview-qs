Question 22 - Picking a survey group
________________________________________
You work for a large hardware company (one that manufactures watches, computers, and phones) and you're trying to 
understand user sentiment towards the company's brand and the products. You decide to send out a survey to a random 
set of users across different products. 

Can you create a query that samples across the different product offerings? The output of your query should be user_id 
and group (e.g. the sampling group the user belongs to).

You have a table with all users and their registered devices. The schema of the table is below:

Table: user_devices
Column Name	Data Type	Description
user_id	integer	id of the user
devices	array of strings	lists the devices (watch, computer, phone) 
device_ids	array of integers	id of the devices used by the user
user_create_time	integer	epoch time of the user's account
total_spend	integer	lifetime spend of a user
country	string	user country
