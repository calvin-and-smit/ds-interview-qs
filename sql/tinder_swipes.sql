Swipe Precision

This question was asked by: Tinder
There are two tables. One table is called `swipes` that holds a row for every Tinder swipe and contains a boolean column 
that determines if the swipe was a right or left swipe called `is_right_swipe`. The second is a table named `variants` 
that determines which user has which variant of an AB test.

Write a SQL query to output the average number of right swipes for two different variants of a feed ranking algorithm 
by comparing users that have swiped the first 10, 50, and 100 swipes on their feed.

Tip: Users have to have swiped at least 10 times to be included in the subset of users to analyze 
the mean number of right swipes.

Example Input:

`variants`

id	experiment	variant	  user_id
1	  feed_change	control	  123
2	  feed_change	test	    567
3	  feed_change	control	  996


`swipes`

id	user_id	swiped_user_id	created_at	is_right_swipe
1	123	893	2018-01-01	0
2	123	825	2018-01-02	1
3	567	946	2018-01-04	0
4	123	823	2018-01-05	0
5	567	952	2018-01-05	1
6	567	234	2018-01-06	1
7	996	333	2018-01-06	1
8	996	563	2018-01-07	0
Note: created_at doesn't show timestamps but assume it is a datetime column.

Output:

mean_right_swipes	variant	swipe_threshold	num_users
5.3	control	10	9560
5.6	test	10	9450
20.1	control	50	2001
22.0	test	50	2019
33.0	control	100	590
34.0	test	100	568
