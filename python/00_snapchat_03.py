Write a function that takes in a list of dictionaries with a key and list of integers and returns a dictionary with the standard deviation of each list.

Note that this should be done without using the numpy built in functions.

Example:

input = [
    {
        'key': 'list1',
        'values': [4,5,2,3,4,5,2,3],
    },
    {
        'key': 'list2',
        'values': [1,1,34,12,40,3,9,7],
    }
]

output -> {'list1': 1.12, 'list2': 14.19}
