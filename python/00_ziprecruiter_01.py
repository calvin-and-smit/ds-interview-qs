existing_ids = [15234, 20485, 34536, 95342, 94857]

names = ['Calvin', 'Jason', 'Cindy', 'Kevin']
urls = [
    'domain.com/resume/15234', 
    'domain.com/resume/23645', 
    'domain.com/resume/64337', 
    'domain.com/resume/34536',
]
We have a list of existing ids that we have already scraped. Let's say we also have two 
lists, one of names and another of urls that correspond to the names in another list with 
the id of the names in the url.

Write code in Python to return the names and ids that we haven't scraped yet.

output = [('Jason', 23645), ('Cindy', 64337)]
