Question 21 - Expanding a data set
________________________________________
You're given a set of data that is aggregated on a monthly basis (as illustrated in Table A). 

Can you write code that can expand this monthly table into a daily table that spreads revenue across the 30 day period (as shown in Table B)? 

You can assume each month has 30 days and that Table A is in a dataframe named "df".
Table A 
index	Month	Revenue ($)
0	1	300
1	2	330
2	3	390


Table B 
index	Month	Day	Revenue ($)
0	1	1	10
1	1	2	10
2	1	3	10
...	...	...	...
30	2	1	11
31	2	2	11
...	...	...	...
60	3	1	13
...	...	...	...
89	3	30	13
