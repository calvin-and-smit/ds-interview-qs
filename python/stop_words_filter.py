This question was asked by: Instacart
Given a list of stop words, write a function that takes a string and returns a string stripped of the stop words.

Example:

stopwords = [
    'I', 
    'as', 
    'to', 
    'you', 
    'your', 
    'but', 
    'be', 
    'a',
]

paragraph = 'I want to figure out how I can be a better data scientist'

Output: 

stripped_paragraph = 'want figure out how can better data scientist'
