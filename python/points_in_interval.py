Question 16 - Points within an interval
________________________________________
You are given j integer intervals in the format [a,b] (e.g. if j = 2, would get list of 2 intervals [a,b], [c,d] 
where a, b, c, and d are integer #s). The absolute value of the coordinates is bound by a value M. 

Build a Python function that determines whether or not a given point belongs to the maximum number of intervals provided.
