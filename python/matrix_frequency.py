Matrix frequencies
Python Algorithms Matrix
Given a matrix of order m*n, find the frequency of even and odd numbers in the matrix.

For example:

#Given the following inputs
m = 2, n = 3
[[ 9, 11, 3 ], 
[ 4, 12, 2 ]]

#Your function should return the following output:
#Frequency of odd #:  3 (since 9, 11, and 3 are all odd #s)
#Frequency of even #: 3
