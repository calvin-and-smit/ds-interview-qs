Question 8 - Checking whether elements in array can be made equal through multiplication

Given an array arr[], write a function to feed in the array elements check whether they can all be made equal by only multiplying the numbers by 2 or 7. (you can multiply by these #s as many times as you like)

If all elements can be made equal, return False, otherwise return True.

Example:

arr[ ] = [128, 4, 2]

128, 4*2*2*2*2*2 = 128, 2*2*2*2*2*2*2 = 128

-- True
arr[ ] = [65, 4, 2]

-- False
