String Subsequence

This question was asked by: Ike

Given two strings, string1 and string2, find out if string1 is a subsequence of string2.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without 
changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example:

string1 = 'abc'
string2 = 'asbsc'
string3 = 'acedb'

isSubSequence(string1, string2) -> True
isSubSequence(string1, string3) -> False
