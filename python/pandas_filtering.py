Question 35 - Filtering student information with Pandas
________________________________________
Suppose you have a dataframe, df, with the following records:

Age	Favorite Color	Grade	Name
20	blue	88	Willard Morris
19	blue	95	Al Jennings
22	yellow	92	Omar Mullins
21	green	70	Spencer McDaniel
The dataframe is showing information about a group of students. 
Write code using Python Pandas to select the rows where the students' favorite color is blue or yellow and their grade is above 90.
