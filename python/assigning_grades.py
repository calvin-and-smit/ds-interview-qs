Question 30 - Assigning grades
________________________________________
You are given a dataframe (df) of students, and you need to assign grades to each student. The table schema is as follows: 
Column name	      Data type	  Example value	    Description
student_name	    string	    Cindy Chu	        Name of student
student_id	      integer	    1837204	          Unique id for each student
class	            string	    Biology	          Name of class
final_grade_pct	  integer	    80	              final grade for class represented in percent


You need to assign the following letter grades based on final_grade_pct in a new column named "final_grade_letter": 
•	>90 - A 
•	81-90 - B 
•	71-80 - C 
•	<70 - D 
Write a function using Python to loop through the table and assign the appropriate letter grades to each student, 
adding a new column to the existing dataframe, df.
