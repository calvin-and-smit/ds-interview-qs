'''
Longest palindrome substring

A palindrome is "a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward." 

Below are some example palindromes:
madam
racecar
tat

Can you write a python function that takes in a string and outputs the longest palindrome? 
If the string itself is a palindrome, the function would output the original string.
