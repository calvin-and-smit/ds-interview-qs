Question 25 - Application feedback
________________________________________
Your team at Apple released a new feature that collects feedback when an app launches. 
As part of the Alpha Launch for testing, the feedback consists of 1 question within a dialog box that asks 
"Would you like to give {App Name} your credit card number?", with potential answers being "Yes" and "No". 

This data is logged within a table named 'dialogbox_feedback' with the following schema:
Table: dialogbox_feedback 
Column Name	  Data Type	  Description
time	        integer	    epoch time of response
user_id	      integer	    unique id of user
app_id	      integer	    unique id of application
app_name	    string	    name of application
event	        string	    Possible values are: impressed (when user sees the dialog box), "Yes" (when user clicks yes). There is no logging for when the user clicks "No".


Question: A Product Manager asked you to give an update on how the Alpha Launch is going. 
You decide to aggregate (e.g. pivot) the events by each app to provide a quick summary. 
Write the aggregation using Python (Pandas).
