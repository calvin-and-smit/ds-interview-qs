Middle matrix sums

Given an integer matrix, m, with an odd # dimensions, n x n, (e.g 3 x 3, 5 x 5, etc), 
find the sum of middle row as well as the middle column.

For example:

#Given
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,9]]

#Your program would output:
'Sum middle row =' 15 #(e.g. 4+5+6)
'Sum middle column =' 15 #(e.g. 2+5+8)
