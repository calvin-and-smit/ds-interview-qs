#Good morning. Here's your algorithms question for today.

#This question was asked by: Microsoft

#Given an array of words and a maxWidth parameter, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters. 
#Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

#Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not 
#divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.


#Example:

words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
maxWidth = 16

'''
Output = 
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]
'''
