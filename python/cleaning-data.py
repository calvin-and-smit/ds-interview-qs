Below is a snippet from a table that contains information about employees that work at Company XYZ:

employee_name	employee_id	date_joined	age	yrs_of_experience
Andy	123456	2015-02-15	45	24
Beth	789456	NaN	36	15
Cindy	654123	2017-05-16	34	14
Dale	963852	2018-01-15	25	4

Company XYZ recently migrated database systems causing some of the date_joined records to be NULL. You're told by an analyst in human resources NULL records for the date_joined field indicates the employees joined prior to 2010. You also find out there are multiple employees with the same name as well as duplicate records for some employees.
Question:
Using Python (with the Pandas library), write code to find the number of employees that joined each month. You can group all of the NULL values as having joined on Dec 1, 2009.
