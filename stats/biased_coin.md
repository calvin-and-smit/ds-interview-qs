# Biased five out of six

## This question was asked by: Google

Let's say we're given a biased coin that comes up heads 30% of the time when tossed.

What is the probability of the coin landing as heads exactly 5 times out of 6 tosses?

Answer:

HHHHHT -> (3/10)\*(3/10)\*(3/10)\*(3/10)\*(3/10)\*(7/10)
HHHHTH -> (3/10)\*(3/10)\*(3/10)\*(3/10)\*(7/10)\*(3/10)
HHHTHH -> (3/10)\*(3/10)\*(3/10)\*(7/10)\*(3/10)\*(3/10)
HHTHHH -> (3/10)\*(3/10)\*(7/10)\*(3/10)\*(3/10)\*(3/10)
HTHHHH -> (3/10)\*(7/10)\*(3/10)\*(3/10)\*(3/10)\*(3/10)
THHHHH -> (7/10)\*(3/10)\*(3/10)\*(3/10)\*(3/10)\*(3/10)
