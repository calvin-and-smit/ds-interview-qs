Question 23 - Drawing cards from a standard deck, once more
________________________________________
Suppose we have a standard (52 card) deck of cards, with an equal share of the cards associated with each of the four "suits" 
(e.g. clubs, spades, diamonds, and hearts)

Question: If you were to draw 3 cards from the deck, one a time, what is the probability that 
you draw a club, a heart and a diamond in any order? Be sure you can explain your reasoning here using probablity theory.

Answer:  
  
3.(13/52).2.(13/52).1.(13/52) = 6*(1/4)**3 = 3/32
