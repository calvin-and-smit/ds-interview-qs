# Lazy Raters


## This question was asked by: Netflix

Netflix has hired people to rate movies.

Out of all of the raters, 80% of the raters carefully rate movies and rate 60% of the movies as good and 40% as bad. The other 20% are lazy raters and rate 100% of the movies as good.

Assumming all raters rate the same amount of movies, what is the probability that a movie is rated good?
