# Estimated Rounds

## This question was asked by: Google

Let's say that there are six people trying to divide up into two equally separate teams. Because they want to pick random teams, on each round, each person shows either a face up or face down hand and if there are three of each, then they'll split into teams. 

What's the expected number of rounds that everyone will have to pick a hand side before they split into teams?
