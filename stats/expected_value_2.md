Question 41 - Rolling dice to win...again
________________________________________
Suppose you are playing a game where there are two fair six-sided dice, and every time you roll the dice and they add up to 9, you win $50. However, to roll the dice costs $20 to play. Is this a game you're willing to play? 

You should be able to attach an expected value to each dice roll using probability theory here.
