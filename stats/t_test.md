# Testing the toxicity of water
# Statistics T-test

Suppose you're trying to measure the Selenium toxicity in your tap water, and obtain the following values for each day:<br/>

day	selenium\n
1	  0.051\n
2	  0.0505\n
3	  0.049\n
4	  0.0516\n
5	  0.052\n
6	  0.0508\n
7	  0.0506\n
The maxiumum level for safe drinking water is 0.05 mg/L -- using this as your alpha, does the selenium tap level exceed the legal limit? Hint: you can use a t-test here
