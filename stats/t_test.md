# Testing the toxicity of water
# Statistics T-test

Suppose you're trying to measure the Selenium toxicity in your tap water, and obtain the following values for each day:<br/>

day	selenium<br/>
1	  0.051<br/>
2	  0.0505<br/>
3	  0.049<br/>
4	  0.0516<br/>
5	  0.052<br/>
6	  0.0508<br/>
7	  0.0506<br/>
The maxiumum level for safe drinking water is 0.05 mg/L -- using this as your alpha, does the selenium tap level exceed the legal limit? Hint: you can use a t-test here
