# Testing the toxicity of water
# Statistics T-test

Suppose you're trying to measure the Selenium toxicity in your tap water, and obtain the following values for each day:

day	selenium
1	  0.051
2	  0.0505
3	  0.049
4	  0.0516
5	  0.052
6	  0.0508
7	  0.0506
The maxiumum level for safe drinking water is 0.05 mg/L -- using this as your alpha, does the selenium tap level exceed the legal limit? Hint: you can use a t-test here
