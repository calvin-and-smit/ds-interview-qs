# Impression Reach

## This question was asked by: Facebook

Let's say we have a very naive advertising platform. Given an audience of size A and an impression size of B, each user in the audience is given the same random chance of seeing an impression. 

1. Compute the probability that a user sees exactly 0 impressions. 

2. What's the expected value of each person receiving at least 1 impression?
