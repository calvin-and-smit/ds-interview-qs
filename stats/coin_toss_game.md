# Secret Wins

## This question was asked by: Google

There are 100 students that are playing a coin-tossing game.

The students are given a coin to toss. If a student tosses the coin and it turns up heads, they win. If it comes up tails, then they must flip again.

If the coin comes up heads the second time, the students will lie and say they have won when they didn't. If it comes up tails then they will say they have lost.

If 30 students at the end say they won, how many students actually did win the game?
