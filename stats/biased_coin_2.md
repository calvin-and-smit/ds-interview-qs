# Same Side Probability

## This question was asked by: Linkedin

Suppose we have two coins. One is fair and the other biased where the probability of it coming up heads is 3/4.

Let's say we select a coin at random and flip it two times. What is the probability that both flips result in the same side?

Answer:

Fair Coin(1/2):
HH -> (1/2).(1/2)
TT -> (1/2).(1/2)

Biased Coin(1/2):
HH -> (3/4).(3/4)
TT -> (1/4).(1/4)

P = (1/2).[(1/4)+(1/4)] + (1/2).[(9/16)+(1/16)] = 9/16 = 0.5625
