Question 36 - Rolling to win!
________________________________________
Suppose you are playing a game with a fair die (e.g. no bias for any one side), and your expected payout based on the # you roll is shown the table below. If you have to pay $1 to play, is it worth the cost to play?

Roll	Payout  
6	$4  
5	$2  
4	$1  
3	$0  
2	$0  
1	$0
