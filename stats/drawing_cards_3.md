Question 26 - Is red independent from an ace? (another card problem)
________________________________________
Is drawing a red card and drawing an ace independent? You can read more about a standard card deck here. 
Hint: Drawing an ace (event A) and drawing a red card (event B) are two separate events 
-- think of a way to prove (using probability theory) that knowing whether event A occurred impacts the probability of event B occuring.
