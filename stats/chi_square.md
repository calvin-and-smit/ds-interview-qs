Relationship between fitness and smoking

Given the data table below, determine if there is a relationship between fitness level and smoking habits:

|                         | Low fitness level | Medium-low fitness level | Medium-high fitness level | High fitness level |
|-------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Never smoked            | 113               | 113                      | 110                       | 159                |
| Former smokers          | 119               | 135                      | 172                       | 190                |
| 1 to 9 cigarettes daily | 77                | 91                       | 86                        | 65                 |
| >=10 cigarettes daily   | 181               | 152                      | 124                       | 73                 |

You don't have to fully solve for the number here (that would be pretty time-intensive for an interview setting), 
but lay out the steps you would take to solve such a problem.
