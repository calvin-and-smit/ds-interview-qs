Question 28 - Winning the lottery!
________________________________________
Suppose you're trying to figure out your chances of winning the lottery. The specific lottery you're interested in has 49 balls, each showing a single number. To win the jackpot you need to match 6 balls to win (note that order does not matter). 

What is the probability that you can win the jackpot, given you buy 1 ticket? 

What if you buy 3 lottery tickets?
